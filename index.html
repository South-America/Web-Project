            <h3>PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY</h3>

            <p>Encyclopedic entry. South America is a continent of extremes. 
               It is home to the world's largest river (the Amazon) as well as the world's driest place (the Atacama Desert).
            </p>
            <p>
              South America, the fourth-largest continent, extends from the Gulf of Darién in the northwest to the archipelago 
              of Tierra del Fuego in the south.
            </p>
            <p>South America’s physical geography, environment and resources, and human geography can be considered 
              separately.
            </p>
            <p>
              South America can be divided into three physical regions: mountains and highlands, river basins, and coastal plains.
               Mountains and coastal plains generally run in a north-south direction, while highlands and river basins generally run in an 
               east-west direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              South America’s extreme geographic variation contributes to the continent’s large number of biomes. A biome is a community of 
              animals and plants that spreads over an area with a relatively uniform climate.
            </p>
            <p id="Sub-section1">
              Within a few hundred kilometers, South America’s coastal plains’ dry desert biome rises to the rugged alpine biome of the Andes mountains. 
              One of the continent’s river basins (the Amazon) is defined by dense, tropical rain forest, while the other (Paraná) is made up of vast grasslands.
            </p>
            <p>
              With an unparalleled number of plant and animal species, South America’s rich biodiversity is unique among the world’s continents.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Mountains & Highlands</h4>

            <p>
              South America’s primary mountain system, the Andes, is also the world’s longest. The range covers about 8,850 kilometers (5,500 miles).
               Situated on the far western edge of the continent, the Andes stretch from the southern tip to the northernmost coast of South America. There are hundreds 
               of peaks more than 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) tall, many of which are volcanic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The highest peak in the Andes, Aconcagua, stands at 6,962 meters (22,841 feet) and straddles the Argentina-Chile border. Aconcagua is the tallest mountain outside Asia.
            </p>
          </div>

        </div>
        <p>
          High plateaus are also a feature of the Andes. The altiplano of Peru and Bolivia, for example, has an elevation of about 3,700 meters (12,300 feet). 
          The Patagonia region of Argentina and Chile consists of lower-elevation plateaus and rugged glaciers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most plants in the alpine biome are small, and their leaves are stiff and strong to protect them from frost and drought. The largest herb in the world, Puya raimondii, 
          is known as the Queen of the Andes. A Puya raimondii can live for 100 years and can grow to more than 9 meters (30 feet) tall. The leaves of this endangered species all grow 
          from one woody stem, allowing moisture to run down the leaves to the base of the plant.
        </p>
        <p id="Sub-section2">
          Outside the Andes, South America has two principal highland areas: the Brazilian Highlands and the Guiana Highlands. Located south of the Amazon River in Brazil, 
          the Brazilian Highlands are made up of low mountains and plateaus that rise to an average elevation of 1,006 meters (3,300 feet). The Guiana Highlands are located between the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers. The heavily forested plateau of the Guiana Highlands covers southern Venezuela, French Guiana, Guyana, northern Brazil, and a portion of southeastern Colombia.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>River Basins</h4>

        <p>
          South America has three important river basins: the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraguay/Paraná.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Amazon River basin has an area of almost 7 million square kilometers (2.7 million square miles), making it the largest watershed in the world. The basin, which covers most of northern South America, is fed by tributaries from the glaciers of the Andes. Every second, the Amazon River empties 209,000 cubic meters (7,381,000 cubic feet) of freshwater into the Atlantic Ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Amazon River is the life force of the equally vast Amazon rain forest, which makes up about half of the rain forest of the entire planet. This tropical biome has as many as 100 different tree species on a single acre, including the rubber tree, silk cotton tree, and Brazil nut tree. Other important plant species include palms, ferns, and ropelike vines known as lianas that 
          network throughout the rain forest’s dense canopy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diversity of animal life in the Amazon rain forest is unsurpassed in the rest of the world. The rain forest is perfectly suited for arboreal, or tree-living, animals. More than 2 million species of insects are native to the region, including hundreds of spiders and butterflies. Primates are abundant—howler monkeys, spider monkeys, and capuchin monkeys—along with sloths, snakes, 
          and iguanas. Thousands of native birds include brightly colored macaws, parrots, toucans, and parakeets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Orinoco River flows north of the Amazon. The Orinoco flows in a giant arc for more than 2,736 kilometers (1,700 miles), originating in the Guiana Highlands of northern Brazil and discharging in the Atlantic Ocean in Venezuela. The Orinoco River basin covers an area of about 948,000 square kilometers (366,000 square miles) and encompasses approximately 80 percent of Venezuela and 
          25 percent of Colombia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Orinoco River flows north of the Amazon. The Orinoco flows in a giant arc for more than 2,736 kilometers (1,700 miles), originating in the Guiana Highlands of northern Brazil and discharging in the Atlantic Ocean in Venezuela. The Orinoco River basin covers an area of about 948,000 square kilometers (366,000 square miles) and encompasses approximately 80 percent of Venezuela and 
          25 percent of Colombia.
        </p>
        <p>
          A vast savanna or grassland region, known as the Llanos, is the primary biome of the Orinoco River basin. The Llanos is primarily made up of grasses. Swamp grasses, sedges, and bunchgrass are found in wet, low-lying areas. Carpet grass is found in the higher and drier elevations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Paraguay/Paraná River basin covers almost 2.8 million square kilometers (1,081,000 square miles), which is much of southeastern Brazil and Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina. The Paraná River includes Iguazu Falls, a massive series of waterfalls that extend for 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles).
        </p>
        <p id="Sub-section3">
          Along with the Uruguay River, the Paraná River empties into the Rio de la Plata estuary between Argentina and Uruguay. The Rio de la Plata is the most populated region of both countries. The capital cities of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay, practically face each other across the estuary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Paraguay/Paraná River basin supplies water to the plains biome, or Pampas, of South America. The Pampas have rich, fertile soil and predictable rainfall patterns. They are the most important grazing and cropland areas on the continent.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Coastal Plains</h4>

        <p>
          A coastal plain is an area of low, flat land next to a seacoast. South American coastal plains are found on the northeastern coast of Brazil, on the Atlantic Ocean, and the western, Pacific coast of Peru and Chile. The coastal plains of northeastern Brazil are extremely dry. 
          The Brazilian Highlands act as a wedge that pushes moist sea winds away from the coastal plains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The western coastal plains are also extremely dry. They are trapped between the cold Peru Current to the west and the Andes Mountains to the east. The Peru Current brings cold water to the Pacific coast of Peru and Chile. This cold surface water results in thermal inversion: 
          cold air at sea level and stable, warmer air higher up. Thermal inversion produces a thick layer of clouds at low altitudes. These low-lying clouds blanket much of the Pacific coast of South America. They do not allow precipitation to form.
        </p>
        <p id="Sub-section14">
          The Atacama Desert is part of the western coastal plain. The Atacama is considered the driest region in the world. The average rainfall is about 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) a year, and some parts of the Atacama have never had rain in recorded history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very few plants grow in this desert. Even bacteria, insects, and fungi are scarce. Larger animal species are also rare, and include the grey fox, a type of deer called the huemul, and the viscacha—the largest member of the chinchilla family. Ocean birds, such as penguins, 
          cormorants, and pelicans, are found on the desert coast. While Atacama lacks flora and fauna, it is a rich source of copper and a chief source of revenue for the Chilean economy.
        </p>

            <h3>HUMAN GEOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p>
              South America’s human landscape is deeply influenced by indigenous and immigrant populations, and their connection to the physical environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              South America, the fourth-largest continent, extends from the Gulf of Darién in the northwest to the Tierra del Fuego archipelago in the south. Along with the islands of Tierra del Fuego, the continent includes the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador), Easter Island (Chile), the Falkland Islands (United Kingdom), and the Chiloé and Juan Fernández archipelagos (Chile).
            </p>
            <p>
              South America and North America are named after Italian navigator <strong><em>Amerigo Vespucci</em></strong>, who was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not part of the East Indies, but an entirely separate landmass. The portions of the landmass that lie south of the Isthmus of Panama became known as South America.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, South America is home to the citizens of <strong><em>Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, the Falkland Islands, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Paraguay</em></strong>.
            </p>
            <p id="Sub-section4">South America has undergone profound changes over the centuries. From thriving indigenous civilizations predating European contact to 
              the complex urban societies of the present day, the region’s human geography reflects a blend of historical, cultural, and environmental factors.

      <br>

      <h4>Pre-Columbian Period</h4>
      <p>
        Before the arrival of Europeans, the Inca Empire was the dominant civilization of South America. 
      </p>
      <p> the Andes Mountains along South America's west coast from about 1200-1532. The mountain ranges helped protect their city-states
        The Inca thrived in
         and allowed for a well-developed government and society.  
      </p>
      <p id="Sub-section5">
        They boasted impressive agricultural terraces, road systems, and urban centers, with the city of Cuzco as their capital. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Their emperor was known as the Sapa Inca, meaning “sole ruler." Manco Capac was the first Sapa Inca and established the Kingdom of Cuzco around the year 1200. 
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4>Colonial Era</h4>
        <p>
           The arrival of Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries marked a transformative period for the people of South America.
        </p>
        <p id="Sub-section6">
          Smallpox and other diseases that the Inca had no immunity for devastated their communities. Colonial rule and the establishment of the forced labor encomienda system only made life worse for millions of indigenous groups across the continent. 
        </p>
        <p>
          New, European-style cities, including Lima and Bogota, were founded as colonial administrative centers, contributing to the emergence of a hierarchical socio-economic structure.
        </p>


      <h4 >Independence and Nation-Building</h4>
      <p id="Sub-section7">
        The 19th century saw independence movements that liberated South American nations from colonial rule. Many of these were led by “The Liberator” Simon Bolivar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following this a period of nation-building was marked by disputes over territory and internal conflicts. Urbanization increased as capitals expanded, railways were constructed, and economic activities diversified.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4>20th Century Industrialization</h4>
      <p id="Sub-section8">
        The 20th century brought significant urbanization and industrialization to South America. Cities such as Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires grew into major industrial hubs, drawing many rural immigrants seeking employment opportunities.
      </p>
        <p>
          The expansion of infrastructure, including highways and dams, helped economic growth but also led to environmental challenges and social inequalities.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Contemporary Trends</h4>
        <p>
          South America is now predominantly urban, with a majority of the population living in cities. Megacities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro face challenges such as informal settlements, traffic congestion, and environmental degradation.
        </p>
        <p>
          South America has experienced immigration flows, contributing to diverse cultural landscapes in countries like Argentina and Chile.
        </p>
        <p id="Sub-section9">
          Despite economic growth in some areas, South America still struggles with socio-economic disparities. Indigenous communities, rural populations, and marginalized urban areas face challenges including poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to education and healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
          The region also faces environmental issues, including deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest, water resource management, and the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>People of the Andes</h4>
        <p>
          The Andes are home to various indigenous communities, each with its distinct cultural practices, languages, and traditions. Quechua and Aymara are among the indigenous groups found in different regions of the Andes. Here are the indigenous people of the Andes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The <strong><em>Quechua</em></strong> people are spread across Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile.

        <h4>People of the Amazon Rainforest</h4>
        <p>
          The human geography of the Amazon Rainforest is as diverse and intricate as the natural environment itself. The region has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years, and their cultures, lifestyles, and histories are deeply intertwined with the rainforest ecosystem. These communities have historically thrived by relying in sustainable practices that are harmonious with the environment. They engage in activities such as hunting, fishing, and gathering, and their deep understanding of the rainforest’s biodiversity contributes to its preservation. Here are the indigenous people of the Amazon:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The <strong><em>Yanomami</em></strong> people are among the largest indigenous groups in the Amazon and have inhabited the rainforest for centuries. They live in the border region of Brazil and Venezuela, and practice subsistence agriculture, hunting, and fishing.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <strong><em>Ashininka</em></strong> people are another large indigenous group in the Amazon. They inhabit both Peru and Brazil and rely on swidden agriculture for sustenance. "Swidden" is also known as slash-and-burn agriculture and is a traditional way of rotating crops over several plots of land in a planting cycle.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <strong><em>Matses</em></strong>, or <strong><em>Mayoruna</em></strong>, live along the border of Peru and Brazil and are known for their traditional knowledge of medicinal plants.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <strong><em>Waorani</em></strong> people traditionally practice hunting and gathering. They have faced challenges from oil exploration, Inhabiting the Ecuadoran Amazon.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <strong><em>Achuar</em></strong> people are found in Ecuador and Peru. They, too, actively resist oil development and maintain sustainable land use practices.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <strong><em>Waiapi</em></strong> people face threats from mining activities, Residing in northern Brazil.</p></li>
          <li><p>The <strong><em>Awa</em></strong> people are found in the eastern Amazon and in Brazil. They confront challenges from illegal logging and land encroachments.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These indigenous groups have faced various challenges over the years, including issues related to land rights, cultural preservation, and economic opportunities. Efforts are being made, both locally and internationally, to support their rights and preserve the cultural and ecological diversity of South America.

            <h3>CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p id="Sub-section12">
              South America is a continent that boasts a variety of cultures and traditions. Shaped by a mixing of indigenous legacies and colonial influences, the region’s cultural diversity creates a complex narrative that reflects the resilience and creativity of its people.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Historic Cultures</h4>
            <p>
              The historic cultures of South America developed in connection with distinct regional landscapes. The three principal regions of early development were the Pacific coast, suited to fishing and trading societies; the major rivers of the Amazon basin, with abundant water, plant, and animal resources; and the Andes, where mountains provided security.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Incan Empire is the most well known indigenous culture of South America. The Inca Empire was established in 1438 in the Andean city of Cuzco, Peru. Over a period of 100 years, the empire expanded to include parts of present-day Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, and Colombia.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to communicate throughout this vast region, the Inca built an expansive network of roads. This network was made up of two main north-south roads, one running along the Pacific coast and another through the Andes. Many east-west roads connected the two. The Inca built forts, inns, food storage facilities, and signal towers along this impressive “foot highway.” These sites, and the highways that connected them, facilitated the Inca’s domination over most of the western part of the continent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The importation of African slaves represented a major shift in the cultural landscape of South America. Most slaves were brought to Brazil. Their unique cultural practices were integrated with indigenous Indian beliefs as well as European rituals.
            </p>
            <p>
              The religious practice of Candomblé, for example, is a uniquely Afro-Brazilian cultural tradition. Candomblé is a combination of traditional beliefs from the Yoruba, Fon, and Bantu cultures of Africa. Priests and other followers of these religions interacted with one another in large Brazilian slave communities. These faiths are polytheistic, meaning they honor many gods and goddesses. Slave owners and church leaders put slaves under intense pressure to convert to Catholicism, a monotheistic, or one-god, religion. Over time, the Candomblé faith incorporated parts of Christianity, such as saints and the display of crucifixes.
            </p>
            <p id="Sub-section13">
              Other historic cultures of South America developed with the physical, as well as cultural, landscape. A distinct gaucho (or “cowboy”) culture developed in the Pampas, for instance. In the mid-18th century, gauchos hunted herds of wild horses and cattle that roamed freely on the extensive grasslands. They then sold their hides and tallow—waxy fat used in making candles and soap—at a high price to European traders.
            </p>

           </div>

        </div>

        <p>
          Much like the North American cowboy, the gaucho was praised as free-spirited, strong, and honest. A popular culture of songs, stories, and films developed around the gaucho image. Gaucho culture still persists, especially in Argentina and Uruguay, where gaucho dress, song, and food are used to evoke national pride.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Contemporary Cultures</h4>
        <p>
          South America’s rich history is explored by contemporary cultures. Organizations are reaching a broader global audience in order to spread social and political messages, and bring in revenue from tourism and investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indigenous societies continue to have a strong presence in South America. COICA, the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, integrates nine organizations that represent each country of the Amazon region. COICA protects indigenous practices, focusing on sustainable use of resources. The group has worked on issues such as environmental legislation, cultural representation, and leadership training for indigenous peoples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Religious practices remain the backbone of many South American cultures. While Catholicism dominates the continent, other spiritual beliefs have influenced both spiritual and secular activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Carnival of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a festival held every year about 40 days before Easter, is an important example of a religious celebration that has been adopted by secular culture. It is both an important event in the Catholic calendar and one of the largest revenue generators in Rio.
        </p>
        <p id="Sub-section15">
          The Rio Carnival is the largest carnival event in the world, attracting millions of Brazilian and foreign tourists. During Carnival season, hotel prices are often four times higher than average. Some tourists pay hundreds of dollars to participate in the parade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most participants, however, are Brazilian. The Rio Carnival incorporates two important social groups—samba schools and blocos. Samba schools are large social groups, often with thousands of members, which create elaborate floats and costumes for the Carnival parade. Blocos are smaller groups that often gather in neighborhoods to dance during Carnival festivities.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Political Issue</h4>
        <p id="Sub-section16">Economics usually drive politics. Accordingly, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia have endured some serious ups and downs in their political environment. <strong>Corruption, authoritarianism, and human rights violations</strong> have been common accusations toward the political leadership of the countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bolivia</strong> is considered one of the poorest countries in South America. In 2006, Bolivia elected a socialist president from the MAS (Movement for Socialism) party who was from a minority Amerindian group rather than a member of the wealthy elite. In Peru, a number of presidents have been forced to resign, and military coups have also produced leadership changes.

        <h5>"Pope Francis Dissolves South American Catholic Group Mired in Scandal"</h5>
        <p style="font-size: 13px;"><strong><em>By Joshua McElwee<br>Jan. 20, 2025, at 1:36 p.m.</em></strong></p>
        <p>
          VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has dissolved a Catholic religious community with members across South America and the United States, following years of investigations into alleged sexual and psychological abuse by the group's founder and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, based in Peru and once numbering some 20,000 members, confirmed its dissolution in a statement on Monday, without offering an explanation. The Vatican did not immediately provide further details.It is rare for the pope to dissolve a Catholic religious community, even one mired in scandal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faced with a similar scandal, Benedict XVI, who was pope from 2005-2013, chose instead to restructure the Legionaries of Christ, a community whose late founder was accused of abusing at least 60 minors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sodalitium, which consists of Catholic laymen and priests, was founded in Peru by Luis Fernando Figari in 1971. Pope John Paul II granted it recognition as an official Catholic religious community in 1997.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group has been the subject of several investigations by the Peruvian prosecutors' office and the Vatican over the last decade. A report commissioned by the society published in 2017 concluded that Figari and other high-ranking former members had abused at least 19 minors and 10 adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          Francis ordered an investigation by the Vatican's top sexual abuse experts in 2023, and expelled Figari from the group in 2024. Figari has denied any wrongdoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Francis has made addressing sexual abuse in the Church a priority of his 12-year-old papacy, with mixed results so far. He created the first papal commission on the issue, but survivor groups have questioned its effectiveness.

        <h5>"Colombia Reissues Rebel Arrest Warrants, Displacement Rises to 32,000 Amid Fighting"</h5>
        <p>
          BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's attorney general's office on Wednesday reissued arrest warrants for leaders of the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, who had been participating in peace talks, as forced displacement caused by ELN attacks rose to 32,000 people.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sharp uptick in violence over the past week in the Catatumbo region, an area along the eastern border with Venezuela considered strategic for drug trafficking, has thrown an already-fraught effort by President Gustavo Petro to end six decades of war into crisis and caused the most pronounced humanitarian catastrophe in Colombia in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Petro, who promised peace and surrender deals to stop a conflict which has killed at least 450,000, suspended talks with the ELN on Friday over their attacks against a fellow rebel group, demobilized former fighters and civilian community leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suspension means his administration will now only potentially ink deals with a small group of rebel and gang organizations, whose members make up just 10% of the rank and file of Colombian armed groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attorney general's office said in a statement it was "revoking the benefits of suspended arrest warrants for 31 representatives of (the ELN) ... who had been recognized by the national government as spokespeople at negotiations."
        </p>
        <p>
          The ELN has said its offensive is against a faction of former FARC rebels, who rejected a 2016 peace deal but are currently in talks with the government, and demobilized rebels who support them. The ELN has denied attacking civilians.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The crisis in Catatumbo continues. We have information about 32,000 displaced people," human rights ombudsman Iris Marin said in a statement late on Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authorities said over the weekend 80 people had been killed. Marin said on Tuesday 35 bodies had been recovered and the armed forces were continuing evacuation measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Security sources say the ELN used its peace talks with Petro's government to strengthen itself militarily and expand its territory.

                    Christ the Redeemer is a 30-meter-tall Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with arms spanning 28 meters. Designed by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and completed in 1931, it was constructed with reinforced concrete and soapstone. Initially envisioned as Christ holding a globe and cross, the design was later changed to the iconic open-arm pose.</p>

                    Easter Island, a special territory of Chile in the southeastern Pacific, is famed for nearly 1,000 moai statues created by the early Rapa Nui people. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995, much of the island is within Rapa Nui National Park. Initially settled around 1200, the Rapa Nui developed a thriving culture but suffered deforestation, European diseases, and slave raids, leading to a population decline to just 111 natives by 1877.

                    The Sechura Desert, located in southern Piura, Peru, spans the Pacific coast and the Andes foothills. Its extreme dryness results from cold coastal upwelling and subtropical atmospheric subsidence but faces occasional flooding during El Niño events. Notable events include a tsunami destroying Sechura in 1728 and the formation of a 145-km-long temporary lake in 1998. Short rivers enable intensive irrigation-based agriculture.</p>
